        It involves keeping track of expenses, income, and savings goals in a
        physical notebook or an app. Kakeibo emphasizes reflection and
        intentionality in spending habits, encouraging individuals to assess
        their financial decisions regularly and adjust their budget accordingly
        to align with their financial goals. This practice aims to promote
        awareness of one's financial habits and foster a more mindful approach
        to money management.
